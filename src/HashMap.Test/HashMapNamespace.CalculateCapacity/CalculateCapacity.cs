Based on the provided method and context, here are several test scenarios for the `CalculateCapacity` method:

```
Scenario 1: Calculate Capacity with Valid Input

Details:

  Arrange: Set up input parameters (initCapacity = -10, loadFactor = 0.75f)
  Act: Call CalculateCapacity(-10, 0.75f, out int limitCapacity)
  Assert: Check if the method handles the negative input gracefully (e.g., returns the smallest prime or throws an exception)
Validation:
  Verify that the method either returns a valid capacity or throws an appropriate exception for negative input
  If a valid capacity is returned, ensure that limitCapacity is correctly calculated

Scenario 7: Calculate Capacity with Very Small Load Factor

  Act: Call CalculateCapacity(100, 1.5f, out int limitCapacity)
  Assert: Check if the method handles the invalid load factor gracefully (e.g., caps it at 1 or throws an exception)
Validation:
  Verify that the method either returns a valid capacity or throws an appropriate exception for an invalid load factor
  If a valid capacity is returned, ensure that limitCapacity is correctly calculated
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `CalculateCapacity` method, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential error conditions. They aim to ensure the method behaves correctly across a wide range of inputs and conditions.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The CalculateUintCapacity method uses unchecked arithmetic operations on uint values, which could lead to integer overflow. This may result in incorrect capacity calculations and potential out-of-bounds access.
Solution: Use checked arithmetic operations or explicitly handle overflow conditions. Consider using BigInteger for large capacity calculations.

Vulnerability: CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
Issue: Casting from uint to int in CalculateCapacity method may lead to data loss if the uint value exceeds int.MaxValue. This could result in incorrect capacity calculations and potential buffer overflows.
Solution: Implement range checking before casting. If the uint value exceeds int.MaxValue, either throw an exception or cap the value at int.MaxValue.

Vulnerability: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
Issue: The GetBucket method uses a simple XOR operation for hashing, which may not provide sufficient randomness for all key distributions. This could lead to increased hash collisions and degraded performance.
Solution: Consider using a more robust hash function, such as MurmurHash3 or xxHash, to improve distribution and reduce collision probability.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The Resize method creates a new HashMap64 instance and copies all elements, which could lead to excessive memory usage and potential denial of service if triggered frequently with large datasets.
Solution: Implement an in-place resize algorithm to avoid creating a new instance. Also, consider adding an upper bound to the maximum allowed capacity.
