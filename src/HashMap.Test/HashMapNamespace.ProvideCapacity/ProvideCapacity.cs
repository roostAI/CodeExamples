   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test attempt to provide capacity which is less than the current limit capacity
  
  Details:
    TestName: TestProvideCapacityLessThanLimitCapacity.
    Description: Test the condition whereby the 'tempIdCount' provided to the ProvideCapacity method is less than the current 'limitCapacity'. This must not perform a resize operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a HashMap with certain 'LimitCapacity' and count.
    Act: Invoke the 'ProvideCapacity' method of the populated HashMap, providing a 'tempIdCount' less than the current 'limitCapacity'.
    Assert: Test if the ProvideCapacity method did not perform the 'Resize' operation.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the capacity remains the same if the provided 'tempIdCount' is less than the 'limitCapacity'. 
    This test validates the initial guard clause in the 'ProvideCapacity' method that checks if a resize operation needs to be performed, enhancing the efficiency of the HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test attempt to provide capacity which exceeds the current limit capacity

  Details:
    TestName: TestProvideCapacityGreaterThanLimitCapacity.
    Description: Test the condition whereby the 'tempIdCount' provided to the ProvideCapacity method is greater than the current 'limitCapacity'. This should trigger a resize operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a HashMap with certain 'LimitCapacity' and count.
    Act: Invoke the 'ProvideCapacity' method of the populated HashMap, providing a 'tempIdCount' greater than the current 'limitCapacity'.
    Assert: Test if the ProvideCapacity method performed the 'Resize' operation.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the capacity is resized if the provided 'tempIdCount' exceeds the 'limitCapacity'. 
    This test validates the resize operation of the 'ProvideCapacity' method to ensure that the HashMap capacity always meets its demands. 

Scenario 3: Test behavior when providing capacity equal to the current limit capacity

  Details:
    TestName: TestProvideCapacityEqualToLimitCapacity.
    Description: Test the condition whereby the 'tempIdCount' provided to the ProvideCapacity method is equal to the current 'limitCapacity'. This should not trigger a resize operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a HashMap with certain 'Limitcapacity' and count.
    Act: Invoke the 'ProvideCapacity' method of the populated HashMap, providing a 'tempIdCount' equal to the current 'limitCapacity'.
    Assert: Test if the ProvideCapacity method did not perform the 'Resize' operation.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the capacity remains the same if the provided 'tempIdCount' equals the 'limitCapacity'. 
    This test validates the resilience and efficiency of the HashMap when it's populated to the capacity limit.
