   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Validate nonempty flag after Node Initialization

Details:
  TestName: TestNodeInitializationFlag
  Description: This test ensures that the nonEmpty flag is initialized to True when a new node is created. The purpose is to check the correct node creation process which includes setting the nonEmpty flag to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new HashMap64Node() with valid parameters.
  Act: Check the NonEmpty property.
  Assert: The returned value should be true.
Validation:
  Assert aims to validate that the nonEmpty flag is set to true after a node is created. It's crucial to ensure that the hash map understands when a node is in use as opposed to being empty.

Scenario 2: Validate correct assignment of Key during node initialization

Details:
  TestName: TestNodeInitializationKey
  Description: This test aims to verify that the constructor correctly assigns the key value during a new HashMap64Node initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new HashMap64Node(), passing a specific long key.
  Act: Retrieve the Key property.
  Assert: The returned key should match the key passed during node initialization.
Validation:
  This ensures that the key is correctly set during initialization, thereby ensuring the correct operation of key-based functionality in the hash map.

Scenario 3: Verify that the node initialization assigns the Value correctly

Details:
  TestName: TestNodeInitializationValue
  Description: This test confirms that the constructor assigns the Value property correctly during a new HashMap64Node initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new HashMap64Node(), passing a specific TValue.
  Act: Retrieve the Value property.
  Assert: The returned value should match the value passed during node initialization.
Validation:
  It's important to confirm that values are correctly set during the node initialization, establishing the correct mapping from keys to values in the hash map.

Scenario 4: Confirm that the node is properly linked to next node 

Details:
  TestName: TestNodeInitializationNextLink
  Description: This test verifies if the constructor correctly assigns the Next property during a new HashMap64Node initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new HashMap64Node(), inserting a valid integer as next.
  Act: Check the Next property.
  Assert: The returned next value should match the value inserted during node initialization.
Validation:
  It confirms that the method correctly assigns the next property during the node initialization. This is critical for establishing and managing the linked list structure within the bucket of the hash map.

Scenario 5: Validate the correct operation of the ToString method for a HashMap64Node

Details:
  TestName: TestNodeInitializationToString
  Description: This test verifies whether the ToString method of the HashMap64Node outputs a string representation in the correct format for the new node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new HashMap64Node() with valid parameters.
  Act: Call ToString method.
  Assert: The returned output should match the string representation of the HashMap64Node in the correct format.
Validation:
  This checks for the correct string representation of the HashMap64Node, which can be important for debugging and readability purposes.
