   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Successful plugin composition from provided plugin location

Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulPluginComposition
  Description: This test verifies that the method ComposePlugins correctly scans the pluginLoader's PluginLocation directory and creates an array of Lazy<IPlugin, IDictionary<string, object>> entries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock IPluginLoader with a valid string for the PluginLocation property and several valid plugins in the referenced location.
  Act: Call ComposePlugins() method with the mock IPluginLoader.
  Assert: Check whether the returned array of Lazy<IPlugin, IDictionary<string, object>> matches the plugins in the mock pluginLoader's PluginLocation.
Validation:
  This test checks that the method correctly locates and composes plugin parts. It confirms that the method functions as expected when provided with valid plugins and directory path.

Scenario 2: PluginLocation in the provided IPluginLoader points to a non-existent directory

Details:
  TestName: TestNonExistentPluginLocation
  Description: This test verifies that the method ComposePlugins handles the case where the directory referenced in PluginLocation does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock IPluginLoader with a non-existent directory path for the PluginLocation property.
  Act: Call ComposePlugins() method with the mock IPluginLoader.
  Assert: Validate the outcome. The handling of an invalid directory path is dependent on the implementation, it might throw an exception or return an empty array.
Validation:
  This test verifies the robustness of the implementation against invalid directory paths. It highlights the need for error handling in cases where the plugin location is incorrect.

Scenario 3: PluginLocation in the provided IPluginLoader is null

Details:
  TestName: TestNullPluginLocation
  Description: This test verifies that the method ComposePlugins handles the case where the PluginLocation in pluginLoader is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock IPluginLoader with null as PluginLocation.
  Act: Call ComposePlugins() method with the mock IPluginLoader.
  Assert: Validate the outcome. Depending on the implementation, it might throw an exception or return an empty array.
Validation:
  This test verifies the robustness of the implementation against null values. It indicates the necessity of null checking in the method.

Scenario 4: Provided plugin loader is null

Details:
  TestName: TestNullPluginLoader
  Description: This test verifies that the method ComposePlugins handles null as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null IPluginLoader.
  Act: Call ComposePlugins() method with null.
  Assert: Check for an exception or an empty array on return based on the implementation.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method is safe to invoke with null parameters. It serves to encourage appropriate null checking in the function implementation. 

Scenario 5: Returning of existing plugins without re-composing

Details:
  TestName: TestCompositionOfExistingPlugins
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the ComposePlugins() method does not re-compose if the `plugins` array already holds plugin references.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock IPluginLoader and set some plugins for `plugins` property.
  Act: Call ComposePlugins() method with the mock IPluginLoader.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned plugins are the same as those set before invoking ComposePlugins() and no re-composition happened.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method works optimally by not attempting to re-compose if plugins are already composed. This is about confirming the efficiency of the method.
